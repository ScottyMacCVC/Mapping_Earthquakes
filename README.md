# Mapping Earthquakes: The New Shake on Things

## We are creating interactive maps using the Leaflet.js library. We use Javascript and HTML to gather information on earthquakes and pull from GeoJSON files. We then add the information to a visually pleasing and usable map. 

## Overview 
Our team would like to view the magnitudes of earthquakes in a given time period. Our information is pulled using an API call from the USGS website in a form of GeoJSON earthquake data. We are able to add our coordinates, magnitudes, and information to the map. The way our script works pulls is based on the date you access the information and will return anything from the past 7 days. The information itself will not plot on the map without the help of Leaflet and Mapbox styles. Our project accesses the information and displays the visualizes the tectonic plates, magnitudes, and coordinates of the event. 

## Reviewing the Map:
